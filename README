This is just a simple little maze-generation algorithm which can draw
and solve simple mazes using JavaScript. The test.html page is an
example of drawing a maze--if you click the drawn maze, it will also
draw its solution. 

The stats.html presents the distribution of the lengths of the random
mazes' solutions. These are generated each time, which takes a while
and may cause browser warnings.
